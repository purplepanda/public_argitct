                                    <p>Administering and managing an Owner’s project obligations is a full-time profession.  Busy Executives, Stakeholders, and Consultants often don’t have the spare time or the required training and knowledge to do this.</p>
                                    <p>ARGitct provides professional executive-level Client-side management, advice, guidance, resources, support, and expertise, in order to establish an optimal “review and input” role for a Client.  This focuses their time on their own knowledge base, supports well-informed decisions, and lets them proceed forward with confidence and clarity that all will go reasonably as expected.</p>
                                    <p>This type of work encompasses a wide variety of aspects, including: project staffing, risk exposure, documentation and contract interpretations, closeout strategies, accounting reconciliations and administrative forensics, litigation and arbitration issues, insurance and warrantee claims, regulatory and board approvals, zoning agreements, lease alteration agreements, funding agreements, property access and neighbor agreements, marketing and public relations, stop-gap and interim services, handover logistics and phasing, business transition modeling, team communications, scope definitions, stakeholder decision-making, aesthetic impact issues, and many other critical issues that develop over the life of the project.</p>

                                    <p>Even the most capable Project Owners, Developers, Managers, and Consultants can sometimes be faced with extremely complex issues or distressed, delayed, or troubled projects.</p>
                                    <p>At these moments, clear-cut and achievable solutions are not always readily evident, and conventional business thinking may not feel like enough to get the job done, much less done well</p>
                                    <p>These projects need a fresh perspective, creative yet practical thinking, macro-to-micro expertise, and an overall can-do attitude to replace “This might not be possible” with “Okay, here’s what will work.”</p>
